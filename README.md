# Roomie

> ðŸš§ This project is still in progress so many of the features have yet to fully be implemented

Roomie is a mobile app meant to keep roommates on the same page. The primary features are shared todo lists, shared calendars, messaging, and peer to peer transactions (reach goal). 

## Mockup

The mockup was made in Figma using the Material Design 3 asset library. Designs are not final (specifically theme) but they give an idea of what the app should look like and how it should function.
